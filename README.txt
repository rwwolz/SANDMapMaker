# SANDMapMaker
Welcome to S.A.N.D. — Please read before you get started!
This application utilizes many powerful python libraries / APIs that are available for free. These must be installed in order for the program to function properly. Below is a list of these libraries:
1) Tweepy (link: http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.6.0/install.html)
    IMPORTANT: Tweepy requires you to have access to a twitter API key (found here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html). On lines     17 and 18 of SAND_1.1.5 enter your valid key and key secret, respectfully, in place of the text.
2) vaderSentiment (link: https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)
3) matplotlib (link: https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
4) basemap (link: https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html)
5) numpy (link: https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
S.A.N.D. will take given search parameters and collect relevant tweets. These are then run through a sentiment analysis program, and tied to their city of origin. The results are then displayed on a map of the continental United States, scaled according to tweet density and colored according to average sentiment.
